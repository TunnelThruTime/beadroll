.SH NAME
beadroll \- create calendar files with multiple events
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBbeadroll\fR [OPTIONS] ARGUMENTS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This section contains the detailed description of the command.
beadroll functions on the basis of adding events to a pickle file. The pickle file
then stores the events which you can modify using the `add` and `rm` subcommands.
.PP
beadroll's main subcommand, `add` has several options as well and these will need some
explanation.
.SH "example command"
.IX Header "example command"
.SH ADD
.IX Header "ADD"
\&\fBbeadroll add\fR [options] NAME BEGIN END
.PP
beadroll's add command is the motor behind the interface.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IX Header "ARGUMENTS"
beadroll add command takes three args: NAME BEGIN END
.PP
The `name` is the name of the event that should be entered as a raw string literal.
the `begin`, and `end` keyword indicates the beginning, and ending time of the event. 
This can be entered using \fBISO 8601\fR formatting.
An example would be \fB"2024\-06\-18T12:00:00\-04:00"\fR.
.PP
The time date format "2024\-06\-18T12:00:00\-04:00" follows the ISO 8601 standard for representing date and time information.
.SH "Breaking it down, formatting for the BEGIN and END timestamp:"
.IX Header "Breaking it down, formatting for the BEGIN and END timestamp:"
\&\- "2024\-06\-18" represents the date in the format of year-month-day.
\&\- "T" separates the date from the time.
\&\- "12:00:00" represents the time in the format of hour:minute:second.
\&\- "\-04:00" represents the time zone offset, with "\-04:00" indicating a 4\-hour offset behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
.PP
So, in this example, the date is June 18, 2024, and the time is 12:00:00 local time, with a time zone offset of \-04:00.
.PP
It should be noted that beadroll does not correct errors in events that you create. This means that
if you create an event that ends before it begins beadroll will generate the ICS file without complaint
and only when you import that file into a calendar application will you get a error.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
This section describes the available options for the `add` command.
.PP
As of version 0.0.1 these features are in development and only one is 
of attention.
.IP \fB\-\-alarms\fR 4
.IX Item "--alarms"
the option takes a string literal from the command line in the form of:
\&\-\-alarms="<string\-literal>"
.Sp
the string takes multiple alarms, each delimited by the keyword `alarm` and
given a special heading. Note that heading cannot be reused. So that each
heading needs a special name. `\-\-alarms="alarm=tower bell, trigger=\-1m, summary=chimes the hour, tower bell, trigger=\-1m, summary=chimes the hour" should only produce one alarm.
.IP \fB\-\-option2\fR 4
.IX Item "--option2"
Description of option 2.
.SH "RM \fBbeadroll rm\fP [OPTIONS] [POINTER]..."
.IX Header "RM beadroll rm [OPTIONS] [POINTER]..."
the remove command is meant to make editing the pickle database feasible, 
although in it's current formation not convenient. To understand the remove
command we have to look at the keyword `pointer`, which is a representation of the 
first argument given to the command.
.PP
beadroll takes the first argument and removes the item from the database's list that 
corresponds to the item. One interesting feature of the `pointer` argument is it's ability
to be used as a slicer. I followed the model of python's slicing for this, and because it
is fairly complicated I'll provide an explanation.
.PP
beadroll's remove command works by removing items from the database. These items are
in turned numerically indexed allowing the user to remove them by using there indexed numbers.
.PP
now consider the word \fI'surcharge'\fR. it's an eight letter word and by definition, if we begin indexing
at zero, the last index should be seven. Slicing works by placing a colon before or after a number to
include each ordinal coming up to, and including, the number, if the colon is placed before, or each ordinal leading away
from the number. In this way ':3' would give us the word \fI'sur'\fR, while '3:' would give us \fI'charge'\fR.
